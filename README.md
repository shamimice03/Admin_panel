This is the admin panel for my "Programming Guide" android application. In my Programming Guide, the android application contains features of online events. Online Events contains several tests, (Quiz test, Coding Test, Interview Question test, Random Test). For maintaining those event data I have developed this admin panel. This will generate the REST API for each test. So that I can parse data in my android application easily. I tried to design a good interface to maintain this admin panel. Anyone interested in this project can try this. password: shamimice03
